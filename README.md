MutWideFOV
MutWideFOV is a mutator for Unreal Tournament 2004 that replaces the standard 90 degrees camera with low-distortion 180x90 degrees one.

This effectively adds extra 90 degrees of peripheral vision. Your perception is gratly enhanced, you can see easily what's happening around you without having to turn around constantly. For example if you are inside a straight corridor, facing one of the ends, you can turn left or right and you'll see both ends at the same time!
